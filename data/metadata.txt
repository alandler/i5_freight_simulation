From forwarded email from Natalie on 11/8
Stations.csv is the original stations in the buffer, with the table exported to a CSV file.  The important column is OID_, which will link to two columns in the next file.
Distances.csv is the table for the lines of the OD cost matrix result.  The OriginID and the DestinationID are the same as the OID_ column in the stations.csv file.  And the distance field is Total_Kilometers.  So on the first row of data, the origin and destination are the same and the distance is zero.  On the second row of data, the origin is 1 (Scripts Green Hosptal) and the destination is 64 (Hilton La Jolla Torre Pines) and the distance between them is 0.85 kilometers.
